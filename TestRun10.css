/* 
the thing wasnt working because the images were not sized properly the default 
size was 400px but i sized it down to 100px. then also i was supposed to add rows and colums not only colums
and also
always make sure to also debug with the developers tools as well coz i wasnt seeing the problem till
we checked the developers tools ( developers tools is debugging on the console)
and also the fact that i had put the photos in a list was also making it a problem to code correctly
